# modman-LethalCompany-(steam)-by-csv4211

modman-LethalCompany-(steam)-by-csv4211 is a simple mod manager for the game Lethal Company.  

There is a ready-made solution called (r2modman (not advertising)), but in my opinion, it seemed unclear, complex, and inconvenient, so I decided to create my own mod manager, which is extremely easy to use.  

Currently, the program is at the Alpha 0.0.5.7 stage and looks like this:

## How the program works

The program works stably with the mod base BepInEx-BepInExPack.  
The "Launch the game with mods" and "Launch the game without mods" buttons respectively launch the game with mods and without mods.  
When you click on one of the buttons, the program overwrites the "doorstop_config.ini" file and changes the line with the "enabled=" parameter to true for launching with mods and false for launching without mods.  
The "Open mods folder" button opens the "plugins" folder, where the game mods are located.  
The "Information" button opens a window with program information, where the date and time at which the update was compiled, the program version, and the author of the program are indicated.  

## Update plans

Main update plans:  
1. Make the program work stably when installing the game outside the Steam folder.  
2. "Big update" Add a beautiful design for the program.  
3. Bring a couple of major updates.
